# 2022DLProject

2022 Deep Learning Project

# Instructions

Your Github repository for this project should contain your PDF report, your DOCUMENTED code/notebook files. It should also contain directions showing the required libraries and steps needed to re-train the model from scratch. And more importantly, it should also contain clear directions on how to recreate the exact trained model and its performance results you are presenting in the PDF, by loading some save PyTorch weights for your model. This is essential, for reproducibility reasons and something that we, researchers, must do constantly for our papers. If the weights files are too heavy to be submitted on edimension or Github, you may upload them to a Google Drive/Dropbox instead.
